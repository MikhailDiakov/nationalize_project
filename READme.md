# ðŸš€ Notionalize API

## ðŸ“– About the project

This project is a service that predicts a personâ€™s likely country of origin based on their name.

It uses two public APIs:

Nationalize.io â€” predicts nationality by name
REST Countries â€” provides detailed country information

The result is a simple but useful tool for analyzing names and related data.

## ðŸ“Œ Startup

To set up and run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository URL>
cd <project directory>
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the API documentation at: [http://localhost/api/docs/#/](http://localhost/api/docs/#/)


## ðŸ“¦ What's inside the .env.example file?

The .env.example file contains all essential environment variables with clear explanations of what each setting does â€” from Djangoâ€™s secret key and debug mode, to database connection details like host, port, user, and password.

Make sure to review it and set your own values before running the project!

## Testing

- **Pytest**:
  ```
  docker-compose --profile test up
  ```
  or in the docker container.
